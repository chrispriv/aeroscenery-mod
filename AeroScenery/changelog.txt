Change log

1.1.3 Mod_j by chrispriv
 - Now also to be used as a moving map for Aerofly reading UDP data port with data streaming 'on' in Aerofly FS2/4 Settings
 - Added "map fixed", "flight tracing" & "hide working tiles" mode, detecting IP address and interpolation for smother movement in moving map
 - Enhanced Search Tile/Location function, which also allows you to search for places, regions etc. (performs geocoding for location search using OpenStreet Map Data) 

1.1.3 Mod_i by chrispriv
 - Added tooltips and hints making the use of AeroScenery easier for beginners, working scenery name kann be set under Settings for easy installation (using "Install Scenery" for selected tiles)
 - New support for downloading elevation data with 10m resolution with USGS as source from OpenTopography for mesh creation (worldwide coverage 30m for other sources as before)
 - Added the selection of typical “Trees Presets” under Settings (works together with the updated version of the TreesDetection App 1.0 Beta from chrispriv)
 - Added the ability to perform an additional batch conversion of raw images to tcc files, which works for Mobile platform Android only (needs content converter from Aerofly FS2 SDK)

1.1.3 Mod_h by chrispriv
 - Geoportals (Switzerland) works again
 - Linz (New Zealand) works again
 - Here WeGo works again (needs now an API key under Settings)
 - Google changed to secured https:// server (line with the <GM_OrthophotoSourceUrlTemplate> has to be manually deleted in settings.xml)
 - Additional PowerShell Script for download of elevation data as GeoTIFF with 30m resolution from OpenTopography for the selected aera/tiles (needs an API-Key to be added in Settings)
 - Ability to integrate QGIS Processing Executor, to fix peaks near coastlines and decompress downloaded GeoTIFF's (Path to GQIS-bin-Folder to be set under Settings)
 - Separate selection boxes for downloading OSM data as well as for download of elevation data from Opentopography under "Choose Actions To Run" (PowerShell scripts are now executed)
 - Ability to define a maximum altitude under Settings for Treesdetection and new handing over of the boundary box coordinates as area restriction
 - Not only in case of missing tiles but now also for empty tiles, only the missing resp. empty Image tiles are downloaded 
 - Enhanced PowerShell Script of Mod_e, fixes not only missing tiles but now also empty tiles (works only partially with Google Satellite Images)

1.1.3 Mod_g by chrispriv
 - Added TreesDetection App by chrispriv in "Actions to Run" & "Settings" to additional run Trees Detection process (with optional masking) based on the stitched aerial image tiles
 - Allows now to change the number of simultaneous downloads in Settings going up to 8 instead of 4 (choice between: 1,2,4,6 or 8 --> recommended 6)
 - New function: "Search Tile" allows to search a specific tile in the map by FS2 grid coordinates (e.g. "8500_a500")
 - Added "Open AFS2 User-Folder" button in the main Toolbar
 - Added "Open Scenery Editor" with link to FS2 Cultivation Editor by Nabeel in the main Toolbar

1.1.3 Mod_f by chrispriv
 - Additional PowerShell Script for manual download of OSM data from OpenStreetMap Overpass API of the selected gridsquare under "osm\"
 - For speed up in case of missing tiles downloads only the missing Image tiles (to redownload all tiles again, the image tile folder must be deleted)
 - New function: Copy boundary box coordinates to clipboard ("NWlng, NWlat, SElng, SElat") for use in AFS2 Editor from Nabeelamjad 
 - Additional "Map Type" "Google Terrain" as map preview ("Open Street Map" replaced by "Open Cycle Map", cause its not supported anymore)
 - Additional choice of "Open in Map" type for Google Earth (Web-Version only)
 - For "Open in Map": Additionally copy the centre coordinates to the clipboard ("<lon> <lat>") for use in TSC-Files of Aerofly
 - For "Open Folder": Additionally copy the name of the selected gridsquare to the clipboard (useful for manually install of the Scenery)

1.1.3 Mod_e by chrispriv
 - New source Mapbox added (needs an access token to be added in Setup)
 - Number of attempts increased from 5 to 10 for downloading tiles for better reliability (for new HTTPS ArcGis as an exception even increased up to 30)
   (never mind if ArcGIS is used, the "Waiting between downloads" should be increased to "15ms" and the "Randomize +/-" to 5ms in the settings (instead of 10ms /3ms))
 - Enhanced PowerShell Script of Mod_c, that allows to download only the missing image tiles manually by running the script (instead of redownload the hole area)

1.1.3 Mod_d by chrispriv
 - ARrcGIS source working again (known issue: few image tiles may be missing)

1.1.3 Mod_c by chrispriv
 - Writing additional list of tiles as a PowerShell Script for manual download of all image tiles to be downloaded (temporary workaround)
